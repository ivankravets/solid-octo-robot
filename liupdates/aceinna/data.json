All about Electric Vehicle Warning Sound Systems\n\nTraditional combustion engine vehicles emit engine sound, even at low travel speeds. Typically, pedestrians and other traffic participants recognize an approaching or departing vehicle through sight and auditory identification of tire sounds and other emitted noise when the vehicle is out of sight.\n\nElectric vehicles (EVs) do not emit engine sound. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) move almost silently when traveling at low speeds and before the conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) kicks in. These vehicles are difficult to hear when travelling at speeds less than 19 mph.\n\nAt greater speeds, tire sound becomes dominant.\n\nGlobal governing bodies are exploring legislation that seeks to establish a minimum level of sound for PHEVs and HEVs when operating in electric mode so that visually impaired people, pedestrians, and cyclists can hear these vehicles approach and determine from which direction these vehicles are approaching.An example of this legislation can be found on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.\n\nAn electric vehicle warning sound system (EVWSS) produces a series of sounds designed to alert pedestrians to the presence of EVs, HEVs, and PHEVs. The driver can initiate warning sounds (similar to the sound from a car horn, but less urgent); however, the sounds must automatically be enabled at low speeds.These sounds vary from artificial tones to realistic sounds that mimic engine noise and tires moving over gravel.\n\nRead the entire article here - https://lnkd.in/gtFRrGnh\n\n#travel #electricvehicles #safety #electricvehicle #pedestriansafety #automotiveindustry #EVWSS"}, {"id": "activity:7058808786374799360", "urn": "urn:li:activity:7058808786374799360", "permalink": "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7058808786374799360", "author": "ACEINNA", "timeFormatted": "1mo", "content": {"type": "image", "source": null, "title": null, "thumbnail": {"width": 609, "height": 866, "url": "https://news.platformio.org/liupdates/aceinna/thumbnail-f704b8dabc.jpeg"}}, "text": "ACEINNA's new IMU330RA Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor named as an Electronic Design Magazine Product of the Week\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/e5ThMzDx\n\u00a0\nAutomotive-Grade IMU Outputs Over Ethernet, CAN-FD\nACEINNA recently released a high-performance, automotive-grade IMU for semi-autonomous cars.

Current Progress and Future Outlook\n\nWhat are the Challenges for Autonomous Vehicles in India\n\nWhile the development of AVs is progressing rapidly around the world, there are unique challenges that need to be addressed before they can become a reality in India. Here are few challenges:\n\nInfrastructure:\u00a0Major challenge is the country\u2019s intracity road infrastructure. Many roads especially state owned are poorly maintained, and there is a lack of proper signage and road markings. This can make it difficult for AVs to navigate and make decisions about how to respond to their environment. Additionally, there may be challenges related to poor lighting and road congestion, which can make it difficult for autonomous vehicles to operate safely and efficiently.\n\nDriving Behaviour:\u00a0Indian driving culture is known for its unpredictability and the tendency of drivers to ignore traffic laws. This poses a challenge for AVs that rely on consistent and predictable behaviour from other drivers on the road. Furthermore, AVs need to be programmed to understand the driving behaviours of Indian motorists, which can be difficult to do given the wide range of behaviours that can be observed on Indian roads.\n\nTechnology:\u00a0The development of AVs requires advanced technology, such as sensors, cameras, and computer systems, which can be expensive and difficult to maintain. This may limit the adoption of AVs, particularly among low-income populations.\n\nRule-Regulation:\u00a0Implementation of AVs in India is the need for a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework. India\u2019s current laws and regulations are not designed to handle the complexities of autonomous vehicles, and there is a need for new policies that can govern the use of this technology on Indian roads.\n\nAccident Liability:\u00a0The key consideration with AVs is determining accident liability. Who should be held accountable for accidents caused by self-driving vehicles? With the software driving the vehicle and making all critical decisions, liability becomes complicated. While early AVs design had a person behind the steering wheel, newer models like those developed by Google lack any physical controls, such as a dashboard or steering wheel. In these designs, passengers have no means of controlling the vehicle in the event of an emergency. Moreover, because passengers are likely to be in a relaxed state and not paying close attention to the road, they may not be prepared to take action if needed. By the time they do realize the need to act, it may already be too late to prevent a collision.\n\nRead the entire article here https://lnkd.in/g4-4gvKv\n#autonomousfuture #autonomousvehicles #automotiveindustry #India #culture #technology #infrastructure "}, {"id": "activity:7054166606196736002", "urn": "urn:li:activity:7054166606196736002", "permalink": "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7054166606196736002", "author": "ACEINNA", "timeFormatted": "2mo", "content": {"type": "article", "source": "https://roboticsandautomationnews.com/2023/04/06/safety-features-of-self-driving-cars/66500/", "title": "Safety Features of Self-Driving Cars", "thumbnail": {"width": 750, "height": 500, "url": "https://news.platformio.org/liupdates/aceinna/thumbnail-92a80cbe2e.jpeg"}}, "text": "What are the Critical Automotive Safety Features of Self-Driving Cars and ADAS?\n\nThis is a great list....\n\nSelf-driving cars are one of the most revolutionary technological advancements of our time.

The global transition towards electrification has led to a surge in demand for EVs, and battery technology is at the forefront of this growth. While lithium-ion batteries have been the go-to power source for EVs for several years, concerns about their sustainability, safety, and limitations in terms of energy density have prompted EV makers to look towards novel battery technologies.\n\nNew battery technologies such as solid-state batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, and metal-air batteries are gaining attention due to their potential to overcome the limitations of lithium-ion batteries. Solid-state batteries, for example, offer higher energy density, faster charging times, and greater safety compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries. Lithium-sulfur batteries, on the other hand, have the potential to offer even higher energy densities, while metal-air batteries could provide extended driving ranges for EVs.\n\nRead the entire article at Battery Technology Magazine  https://lnkd.in/g2zVejgA\n#tesla #energy #electriccars #electricvehicles #evbatteries #evcharginginfrastructure #batteries #technology #power #electricvehicle "}, {"id": "activity:7053818989210189824", "urn": "urn:li:activity:7053818989210189824", "permalink": "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7053818989210189824", "author": "ACEINNA", "timeFormatted": "2mo", "content": {"type": "article", "source": "https://jalopnik.com/autonomous-vehicles-need-to-learn-about-road-rage-1850343865", "title": "Autonomous Vehicles Need to Learn How to Deal with Aggressive Drivers", "thumbnail": {"width": 800, "height": 450, "url": "https://news.platformio.org/liupdates/aceinna/thumbnail-83b0d0cf52.jpeg"}}, "text": "Autonomous Vehicles Need to Learn How to Deal with Aggressive Drivers\n\nHumans can identify angry, stressed-out motorists easily.

It was one of Tesla\u2019s promises, and if we look at where we are today, Tesla has still not achieved full autonomous driving features.\u201d\n\nThe only automated features have been implemented by European and Japanese OEMs, and these features are still limited to highways, with driving speeds up to 60 km/h, Boulay said. \u201cIt is almost a useless feature and quite far from what people expected 10 years ago.\u201d\n\nRead the entire article here https://lnkd.in/gRxNCy86\n\n#tesla #automotiveindustry #Perceptionsensors #IMU #INS #autonomousfuture #future #autonomousvehicles #selfdrivingcars "}, {"id": "activity:7047568226729283584", "urn": "urn:li:activity:7047568226729283584", "permalink": "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7047568226729283584", "author": "ACEINNA", "timeFormatted": "3mo", "content": {"type": "article", "source": "https://eepower.com/technical-articles/beware-of-these-electric-vehicle-charging-challenges/#", "title": "Beware of These Electric Vehicle Charging Challenges - Technical Articles", "thumbnail": {"width": 800, "height": 400, "url": "https://news.platformio.org/liupdates/aceinna/thumbnail-3eb45f690f.jpeg"}}, "text": "What are the top Electric Vehicle Charging Challenges?\n\nThe batteries and charging systems associated with electric vehicles play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and cost of these vehicles.

Is enough being done to accelerate EV adoption, given national targets to go electric?\n\nSome of the carmakers definitely think they are chasing their own tail. This week, Ford\u2019s managing director for the U.K. and Ireland, Lisa Brankin, told the Financial Times that switching to 100% electric vehicles requires a wealth of public charging infrastructure but that (in the U.K.), there doesn\u2019t appear to be a plan in place to allow that to happen. This comes as globally, Ford reported financial results yesterday that showed its Ford Model e business, the name it has given to its EV unit, expects a full-year loss of about $3 billion this year.\n\nIn another announcement, Renault is said to be in talks with Nissan about synergies in EV charging in 11 European countries. According to Reuters,\u00a0Renault\u2019s charging unit CEO, Nicolas Schottey, said they are in talks already about adding charging boxes that customers in France can have installed at home for their Nissan EV to be supplied by the Mobilize unit of its partner Renault.\n\nAt least the U.S. government has started taking EV charging seriously. The Biden\u2013Harris administration last week opened applications for a new multi-billion\u2013dollar program to fund EV charging and alternative-fueling infrastructure in communities across the country and along designated highways, interstates and major roadways. The U.S. Federal Highway Administration said this is a key step toward the president\u2019s goals of building a national network of 500,000 public EV charging stations and reducing national greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% by 2030.\n\nThis is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Discretionary Grant Program, established by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, to provide $2.5 billion over five years to a wide range of applicants, including cities, counties, local governments and tribes. This round of funding makes up to $700 million funding from fiscal years 2022 and 2023 available to strategically deploy EV charging and other alternative vehicle-fueling infrastructure projects in publicly accessible locations in urban and rural communities, as well as along designated\u00a0alternative fuel corridors."}, {"id": "activity:7044316494352052224", "urn": "urn:li:activity:7044316494352052224", "permalink": "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7044316494352052224", "author": "ACEINNA", "timeFormatted": "3mo", "content": {"type": "article", "source": "https://insights.globalspec.com/article/20107/when-will-electric-vehicles-outnumber-ices", "title": "When will electric vehicles outnumber ICEs?", "thumbnail": {"width": 752, "height": 423, "url": "https://news.platformio.org/liupdates/aceinna/thumbnail-24935802d8.jpeg"}}, "text": "Are you ownderign when will electric vehicles outnumber ICEs?\n\nWhile the internal combustion engine (ICE) is still king of the road, sales of these vehicles peaked in 2017, according to a report by industry analysts at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Since then, as sales of electrified vehicles \u2014 electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrids (mild, plugin, and hybrid vehicles) \u2014 have increased, the demand for fossil-fueled transport has been in permanent decline.\n\nWhat is more, sales of EVs are expected to triple from the current levels by 2025. And with legislation set to add further impetus to electrification, manufacturers, governments, analysts and the public are asking: When will EVs and hybrids outnumber combustion vehicles?\n\nThis a simple question that unfortunately has no simple answer.\nThe time it takes for EVs to overtake\u00a0ICEs\u00a0in the sales race will be significantly shorter than the time it will take for EVs to dominate the roads. To complicate matters even further, there are differing definitions of what constitutes an EV, and of course, the phase-out of ICEs will not happen simultaneously across the globe.\n\nRead the G;obalSpec article here https://lnkd.in/g6KAAMCu\n\n#electricvehicles #evcharginginfrastructure #energy #automotiveindustry #phev #hev #bevs #currentsensor #imu #ADAS"}, {"id": "activity:7043960614284652544", "urn": "urn:li:activity:7043960614284652544", "permalink": "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7043960614284652544", "author": "ACEINNA", "timeFormatted": "3mo", "content": {"type": "article", "source": "https://aceinna.isolvedhire.com/jobs/824849-305633.html", "title": "Hardware Development Test Engineer - Tewksbury, MA", "thumbnail": {"width": 200, "height": 200, "url": "https://news.platformio.org/liupdates/aceinna/thumbnail-c9be94a9c1.jpeg"}}, "text": "ACEINNA is looking for a Hardware Development Test Engineer\n\nThe Hardware Development Test Engineer will work closely with the ASIC and sensor design teams throughout the product development cycle.
